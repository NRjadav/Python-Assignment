Q1:Why do we use anonymous function?

ANS:

==> The advantage of an anonymous function is that it does not have to be stored in a separate file.

==> This can greatly simplify programs,as often calculations are very simple and the use of anonymous functions
    reduces the number of code files necessary for a program.
