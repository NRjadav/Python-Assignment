Q1: What is init?

ANS:

==> The __init__ mrhtod is the python equivalent of the c++ constructor in an object-oriented approach.

==> The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class.

==> The __init__ mehtod lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose.

==> It is only used within classes.
