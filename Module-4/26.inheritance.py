Q1: Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?

ANS:

==> Inheritance relationship defines the classes that inherit from other classes as derived, subclass, or sub-type classes.

==> Base class remains to be the source from which a subclass inherits.

==> For example, you have a base class of "Animal", and a "Lion" is a derived class.

==> The Inheritance will be Lion is an Animal.
